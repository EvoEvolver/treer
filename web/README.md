# Treer control plane

Agent operations use stable IDs. Display names are unique within a Tree folder,
so the same label can appear in different folders. Hover a workload row to see
its complete path; the selected Agent's header shows folder breadcrumbs. The
full-screen mobile header shows the complete path. Machine and audit inventories
show the canonical path, falling back to a stable ID when unavailable.

Use **Copy path** in the workload menu to copy an absolute Treer Tree path, such
as `/research/reviewer`. Pass it as a single CLI argument, for example
`treer agent read /research/reviewer`; quote paths containing spaces. These paths
are workspace Tree addresses, independent of a machine working directory.
Rename, create and move conflicts keep the editor open and display the backend's
error. Renaming or moving retains the selected Agent's stable identity.

**Edit startup command** reads the current argv and saves it through one restart
operation. The editor scrolls on short mobile screens and preserves input after
a denied operation. Managed Apps have separate settings; their startup editing
requires the forthcoming App update API.

## Local verification

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

Browser tests mock the API and workspace events. The test runner creates a
throwaway HOME and allows only basic process environment variables, excluding
Agent identities, workload credentials, provider settings and HTTP proxies. It
starts its own loopback Vite process and never reuses an existing server. Set
`PW_PORT` to select a free port. Playwright browser binaries must be installed;
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` may point to an existing installation.

The same-name Agent and startup editor cases cover desktop and 390px viewports;
the long-command editor test writes desktop and mobile screenshots under the
ignored `test-results/` directory for visual inspection.
